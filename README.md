Hello world! Here is Mobazha.

Welcome to the decentralized world!

--

Mobazha is a mobile app that runs the decentralised marketplace. It is composed of two major parts:

1. The react-native _client_ (i.e. this repository)
2. The Golang Mobazha server (originally Openbazaar), which is compiled into a library/framework for iOS and Android devices using gomobile

The app enables users to access a global decentralised marketplace for goods and services, where they can use a variety of supported cryptocurrencies (BTC, BCH, LTC, and more coming) for payments.

The Mobazha project is forked from Haven and OpenBazaar. The Mobazha team would maintain the project for the community.
