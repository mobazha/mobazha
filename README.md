[![Build Status](https://app.bitrise.io/app/9c4f0ff60d38782d/status.svg?token=PdrfhQM1NCRlGC-HFRRwMw&branch=develop)](https://www.bitrise.io/app/9c4f0ff60d38782d)

Haven is a mobile app that runs the decentralised marketplace, [OpenBazaar](https://openbazaar.org). It is composed of two major parts:

1. The react-native _client_ (i.e. this repository)
2. The Golang OpenBazaar server, which is compiled into a library/framework for iOS and Android devices using gomobile

The app enables users to access a global decentralised marketplace for goods and services, where they can use a variety of supported cryptocurrencies (BTC, BCH, LTC, ZEC, ETH, CFX) for payments.

The Mobazha project is forked from Haven. The Mobazha team would maintain the project for the community.
